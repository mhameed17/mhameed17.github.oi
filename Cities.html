            <h2> 1. Maldives </h2>
            <p> The island nation of the Maldives is popular with honeymooners
              looking for seclusion and adventurers looking to explore the
              depths of the sea on a scuba diving and snorkeling excursion.
               Travelers seeking relaxation can unwind at one of the island
                spas and all visitors should certainly spend a day exploring
                the Maldivian capital of Malé. The hotels in this region are
                also spectacular, ranging from underwater hotels to overwater
                private bungalows. However, getting to and staying in this
                 tropical paradise requires patience (there are no direct
                 flights from the United States) and plentiful cash. Located
                 between the Arabian and Laccadive seas, roughly 500 miles
                 southwest of Sri Lanka, the Maldives is about as isolated
                  as you can get – and that's just another one of its many
                  allures. <a href="file:///Users/macbookpro/Desktop/HTML%20and%20CSS/Streetfoods.html"> For best food around the world-Click here!</a> </p>

              <h2> 2. Tokyo</h2>
              <p> "Animated" is perhaps the best word to describe Tokyo.
                Crazy about its anime, Japan's mega city is constantly
                buzzing with movement – feet clacking down sidewalks, cars
                zooming along streets, subway trains humming below ground,
                ships cruising in and out. And yet bright lights and loud
                signs beg you to pause, to break your motion for just one
                second to pray (oops, we mean pay) at the altar of consumerism.
                This is a city that feeds on motion and progress. </p>

              <h2> 3. Bali </h2>
              <p> Shangri-La, Elysium, Arcadia, Utopia and Bali are all
                synonymous with "heaven." The only difference between them is
                that you can actually visit Bali. Many travelers have never
                been to this Indonesian island. Yet, the word "Bali" conjures
                daydreams of the most fantastical landscape: towering volcanoes
                 wrapped in a deep green canopy, sandy shores that fade into
                 turquoise waters and curving coastlines crowned with staggered
                  pagodas. And believe it or not, Bali rarely disappoints.</p>

              <h2> 4. Kabul </h2>
              <p> Afghanistan which is at the crossroads of the great
                civilizations of history has created a surprising variety
                of food, art, language, and tradition. This diversity is
                evident in all the cities of Afghanistan. Kabul the bustling
                 capital of Afghanistan is proud of its heritage as the main
                 commercial city between East and West. Today it is the
                 central market in Afghanistan. Although Kabul has undergone
                 major changes with modern buildings and heavy traffic, the
                  bazaars and other monuments of the old town remain the
                  center of life </p>

                <h2> 5.Delhi </h2>

                <p> Delhi, the capital of India, offers a sedate blend of
                  culture, art and modern architecture. It attracts thousands
                  of tourists every year with its mesmerizing natural scenic
                  wonders and awe inspiring development. It also attracts a
                  sea of professionals who visit the city for official purposes.</p>

                <h2> 6. Paris </h2>

                <p> The City of Light draws millions of visitors every year
                  with its unforgettable ambiance. Of course, the divine cuisine
                  and vast art collections deserve some of the credit as well.
                  The gentle River Seine rambles through the city, flanked by
                  stately museums, centuries-old churches, and blocks of
                   Rococo- and Neoclassic-design architecture, further enhanced
                    by cascading trees and glowing streetlamps. Peppering the
                    Seine's cobbled walks and graceful bridges are impossibly
                    chic Parisians, probably on their way to the market, cafe
                    or cinema. </p>

                  <h2> 7. London </h2>
                  <p> The English writer Samuel Johnson famously said,
                    "You find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to
                    leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London,
                    he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life
                    can afford." More than two centuries have passed since
                    Johnson's era, but his words still ring true. Life in
                    London is nothing short of invigorating, and travelers
                    find that one visit isn't enough to experience everything
                    this two-millennia-old city has to offer. </p>

                    <h2> 8. Santorini </h2>

                    <p> A massive volcanic eruption around 1650 B.C. forced
                      the center of what was then a single island to implode
                      and succumb to the sea. Some say that this was the
                      original home of the lost city of Atlantis, which long
                      ago disappeared into the ocean's depths. Whatever remains
                      of this mythological metropolis is now guarded by
                      beautiful beaches and stately whitewashed homes.
                      Today, Santorini consists of two inhabited islands and
                      several islets. Most visitors spend their time on Thira
                      (the archipelago's largest island), which is home to
                      Santorini's major towns, including Fira and Oia. Sleepy
                      Thirassia makes for a relaxing daytrip too. </p>

                      <p> If you enjoy visiting exciting and vibrant cities,
                        you’ll love Toronto, which is also Canada’s largest
                        city and the capital of Ontario. It is also a very
                        cosmopolitan one, where more than 140 languages are
                        spoken. It is, in fact, the most multi-culturally
                        diverse city on the planet. Currently, Toronto is
                        undergoing an urban revitalization, so you’re likely
                        to find many new and stylish neighborhoods rising out
                        of former industrial areas. Plus, you’ll never be bored
                        in Toronto as it attracts numerous big events,
                        including the well-known Toronto International
                        Film Festival. While in Toronto, make sure to check
                        out one of Canada’s most iconic landmarks, the CN Tower,
                         currently the 3rd tallest tower in the world. </p>

                    <p> Nickname: “The Big Apple” and “The City that Never Sleeps”
                      Why You Should Move: Fast-paced and energetic, New York
                      City is home to many of the world’s most iconic
                      neighborhoods, restaurants, museums and neighborhoods.
                      The Big Apple is also one of the largest cultural and
                      financial hubs in the world. Though real estate in the
                      city is exceptionally expensive, the plethora of
                      amenities and job opportunities make it one of the best
                      places to live in the world. </p>
