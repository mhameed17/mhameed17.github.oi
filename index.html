              <h2 >Top 15 Budget-Friendly Travel Destinations Around the World</h2>
              <p > One of the biggest misconceptions people have when thinking
                about international travel is that it is going to cost a fortune.
                The reality is that most people are able to travel, often times
                long-term, on a relatively tight budget.</p>

              <p>  While flights can typically account for the biggest expense,
                budget accommodation and eating inexpensively can bring down
                costs significantly. And, most importantly, the actual destination
                of your trip can play a big factor in your budget.</p>

              <h2>Asia, The Continent of Dreams</h2>
              <p> Not only the largest continent on Earth but the most
                 populous too, Asia is home to some of the most astounding and
                 alluring cities in the world. The sheer variety and diversity
                 means that each city has its own unique look, feel, and identity,
                 with something new to discover wherever you go.</p>

              <p> While some are renowned for their fantastic culinary scenes
                and pounding nightlife, others boast breathtaking historical
                sights and cultural landmarks. Their settings vary too: some
                are set on beautiful bays while others are perched amongst the
                 mountains or nestled away in arid deserts. </p>
