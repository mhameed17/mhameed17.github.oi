      <h2> Exploring exotic places doesn’t have to cost a fortune </h2>
       <p> You certainly don’t need to win the lottery to travel the world – not if you know how
       to watch your pennies. We’ve complied some tried and tested tips to help
       you plan a holiday on a budget. <a href="file:///Users/macbookpro/Desktop/HTML%20and%20CSS/index.html"> Need further assistance?</a>  </p>

       <h2> 1. Plan ahead </h2>

       <p>Travelling spontaneously is great, if you have the luxury of time and money
       to spare. But if you’re travelling on a budget, the first thing to do is come
       up with a plan. You don’t have need a tight, hour-by-hour itinerary, but you
       should at least have an idea of how long you’ll be spending in each city or
       country, and know the route that your epic adventure will take. Leaving less
       to chance means less unexpected spends; last-minute flights and accommodation
       are often far more expensive. </p>

   <h2> 2. Travel out of season </h2>

        <p> Avoid trips during the school holidays, this is when the travel
        industry hikes up prices to take advantage of families who can
        only travel during these weeks. Research the best time to visit your
        intended destination, and then travel just before or after these dates.
         This is called the ‘shoulder season’, where you’ll still have a great
         trip but maybe the sun won’t shine quite as brightly (and, on the plus
         side, it won’t be quite as hot.) Hotels and airlines lower their prices
         to attract customers during this time.</p>

      <div>
         <h2> 3. Be accommodation-savvy</h2>
         <p> Trade expensive hotel suites for dorm rooms in hostels.
         Sharing a room naturally divides the costs and communal bunk rooms
         offer the opportunity to meet people who might be keen to explore
         with you. Other great alternatives are websites like AirBnB and
         Couchsurfing, where you simply book a spare room in a local person’s
         house or apartment. It’ll halve the price and allow you an authentic
         snapshot of real life in the city. Consider your host your very own,
         personal tour guide, filled with insider-tips for the best eateries
         and tourist spots in that neighbourhood.

         You could even stay with family or friends. Reach out to people you
         know or plan a trip to somewhere that a long-lost cousin or school
         friend now lives – this could take you to visit places you’d never
         have thought of before. </p>

         <h2> 4. Pack properly </h2>
         <p> Make sure you bring everything you need so that you don’t have to
         shop while you’re away (apart from a few souvenirs). No matter where
         you’re heading, take at least one pair of long jeans, warm hoodie and
         waterproof jacket for unpredictable weather incidents. For some
         in-depth advice, check out our ‘Travel like a pro’ guide to packing
         for every kind of trip. </p>

         <h2> 5. Book flights in advance… </h2>
         <p>
           Especially return flights; running out of money abroad without a
           guaranteed ticket home is never ideal. Airlines ‘release’ their
           flight seats up to a year in advance and the closer you get to your
           departure date, the more the prices increase, especially in the
           last month. </p>

         <div>

           <h2> 6. …and be smart about how you fly </h2>

           <p> Opt to travel on a Tuesday. Midweek travel prices are lower
             as a premium is added to weekend flights and you’ll breeze through
             shorter queues at airport check-in desks and security. Fly economy
              too – there’s no need to upgrade, no matter how nice Business
              Class looks. The money you save on cheap seats can be spent on
              food or accommodation when you arrive. Low-cost, budget airlines
              are fine for short flights and regularly have cheap deals.
              If you’re planning a weekend trip try to pack light and use only
              hand luggage, saving yourself a bit of money on hold luggage. </p>

            <div>

          <h2>  7. Embrace public transport </h2>
          <p> Buses and trains are cheaper than planes. It’s that simple!
            A journey on an overnight train also mean you have one less night
            in a hostel to pay for… </p>

          <div>
            <h2> 8. Don’t eat away your cash </h2>

            <p> Cheap lunches can be bought in a supermarket or even a local
              fresh food market, rather than in an overpriced cafe or
              restaurant. Aim to wander around before choosing a place to eat
              dinner too; if you just pick the first restaurant you see you
              won’t know if you’re overspending. Drinking beer with every dinner
              soon adds up – both your wallet and your waistline will thank you
              if you opt for water instead sometimes. Alternatively, hostels and
               spare rooms often let you have access to a kitchen if you want
                to save a little money by cooking for yourself. </p>

              </div>
              <div>
            <h2> 9. Earn while you travel </h2>


            <p> Working holidays are a brilliant way to afford to spend
              several months of the year (or more) living the travel dream:
              Teach skiing on a winter season, take care of holidaymakers
              travelling to the Mediterranean in the summer, or earn by
              teaching a language in Thailand; you could even freelance while
              traveling if you’re able to work “on the go”. The opportunities
              are literally endless. </p>

            <div>
            <h2> 10. Be flexible with your plans</h2>
            <p> When you are traveling on a budget, it is possible that
              everything may not work out the way you planned. Bad things
              can happen to you from time to time, and you should be
              ready for it. You might get stuck in a bad situation and
              lose some money; you might not get a refund on something you
               were assured you will. When such situations of misfortune
               arise, you must embrace changes and adjust your plans
               accordingly. </p>
               <p> If you are a budget traveler, you will discover
               and sometimes even invent some hacks to make your traveling
               cheap. But one thing on which there is universal agreement
               and which you must follow is, “Do in Rome as the Romans do,”
               i.e., go local, and you will find traveling not as expensive
               as people think. </p>
